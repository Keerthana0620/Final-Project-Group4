# Project Overview
## Data Preprocessing
The original dataset is about 3gb+. To use the dataset efficiently, it is necessay to create a reduced dataset, ' '.

## T5 Model Training
- 1. data_preprocessing.py
- 2. prepare_data.py
- 3. train.py
- 4. generation.py
- 5. evaluation.py

## Usage
python3 generation.py --model_dir /tmp/pycharm_project_809/NLP/Final_Project/T5/scripts/models/checkpoints/checkpoint-32902 --prompt "President Trump said that china is" 
--max_length 500 --num_return_sequences 5

If it used in the terminal, the below factors should be revised.

- 1. the location '/tmp/pycharm_project_809/NLP/Final_Project/T5/scripts/models/checkpoints/checkpoint-32902' should be changed to the location where check-point-32902 is located.
- 2. the prompt "President Trump said that china is" should be revised
- 3. the max_length 500 can be revised, default is 500.
- 4. the num_return_sequences 5 can be revised, default is 5.
