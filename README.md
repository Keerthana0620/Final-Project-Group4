The dataset for this project will be a collection of recent news articles. Articles will either be scraped from publicly available news websites or sourced from an existing news corpus, such as the CNN/DailyMail dataset or the Newsroom dataset, which provide article headlines, descriptions, and full-text articles. These datasets are suitable for training models to generate article descriptions.
