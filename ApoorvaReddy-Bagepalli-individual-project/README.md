## Markov Chain Model 
This sub-repo is individual contribution by Apoorva Reddy Bagepalli
It consist
- Code folder
- Final Individual report

### Environment Setup
1. pre-processing.py : Let's you download the main data and pre-processes the data before proceeding to batch processing
2. batch_processing.py : It takes the cleaned data and saves each fixed length data in batch files under cleaned_batch folder which allows easy to run Markov chain model.
3. Markov.py : This is the main code, it consist of four variation of Markov Chain for the purpose to check which one workes better.
